I am writing to you about this job position: \urlstyle{same}\href{\positionurl}{Laboratory Technician (Full Time) - Bart Lab (via Danforth careers website)}. I recently defended a master’s thesis in plant evolutionary genomics and am looking to connect with researchers in applied crop sciences.

For the last two years, I have spent my time as a student scientist doing basic research trying to understand repeated themes of evolution in green plants. Having spent the last couple of years doing basic research I want to explore the field and research of crop sciences some more before I move forward as a student scientist. This is when I came across Danforth and this job posting.

I spent the last two years learning the power of inferential/comparative genomics and want to get in touch with expertise/research who take the inferences from computational genomics a step further towards real world applications. I am especially interested in learning about the potential that computational biology holds towards aiding small scale agriculture and plant based medicine.

As for my qualifications for the position, I feel confident that I match the job’s requirement. I have been a full time graduate student for the last couple of years. I have worked on my own projects as well as collaborated with small/large groups of scientist to conduct, document and present novel research, both wet lab and dry.

I am writing to you about this job position: \urlstyle{same}\href{\positionurl}{Indeed.com}. I recently defended a master’s thesis in evolutionary genomics and am looking for growth opportunities.

My master’s thesis was a bioinformatics project that employed genomics data and data analysis tools (R, Python, BASH) to generate phylogenetic/evolutionary genomics inferences regarding plant evolution. I particularly enjoyed the programming side of things in my master’s thesis and so am interested in this programming-oriented position.

As for my qualifications for the position, I feel confident that I match the job’s requirement. I did an entirely project oriented master’s and finished it a semester early. I am also familiar with the logistical challenges associated with genomics data and how sprawling the files/folders/experiment can get. My master’s thesis was an endeavor in novel research that entailed problem solving and critical thinking skills. Throughout the thesis, I worked under the tutelage of 4 committee-members with broad research interests. I am familiar with the challenges of documenting/presenting/communicating graduate-level scientific research.

I have collaborated with small and large teams using tools such as Python, R, Bash, and various software packages produced and maintained in genomics research. I am familiar with the multiple applications and challenges that arise with programming languages, data analysis tools, and statistical models/methods used to make the most out of the raw data at hand. 
>>>>>>> parent of 9fc2e8a... The cover letter for washu:Templates/cover_letter/cover_letter.tex

As for the preferred technical skill-set, I am happy to invite you to take a look at my GitHub and see if my code (Python/R/BASH) looks worth your while. 

% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position. 

I believe this position would be an excellent opportunity for me to bring together my current skill set and future goals.I would love to hear back from you and see if I am a good fit for this role.

Sincerely,

\name
