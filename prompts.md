I am trying to make a cover letter template in Xelatex. Show me a basic setup where I can define most everything in a `.cls` file.

1. Use the article class.

2. For the setup, use reusable variable for a name holder for the person, phone number, email, for address, for github, for linkied in. A variable place holder for the company's name and the url to the postion

3. Make the doucment include the current date, such that each time I compile the date updates.

4. Make sure that the name shows up in large letters, centered, with name the first two letters of the last name and first name in bold and the rest of the letters in non-block letter. 

5. Then below this have github, linkedin, email, phone number, address listed with `|` to separate them (have them in a single line). Use hyperlinks for github and linedin and email, where they show up as the words github, linkedin and but let the whole email show.

6. After this have the today's date in the right hand above the body of text.

7. Then address the company's name, then the hiring recruiter and then have the body of text.
